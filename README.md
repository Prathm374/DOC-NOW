We are aiming to create an interactive and easy to use, simple healthcare app that allows users to book appointments in hospitals including the government hospitals so as to avoid the wastage of time in long queues outside the government hospitals. Additionally we have provided solutions which include online consultation with a doctor, order medicines and other services, bed reservation option for serious patients and most importantly we are adding a AI diagnosis system into the website so as to reduce the dependancy on the availability of doctors.
We have now connected all the form data to mongodb database using express.js so that now all the entered data in the form is stored in the main database and can be accessed anytime.
